## algorithm-benchmark

This software was developed as a project for my Computer Science degree, 3rd semester, under the title “MAKE A SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FOR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF DATA SORTING ALGORITHMS.”

It includes several packages and classes, which are explained below:

- `benchmark`
This package contains only the Main.java class, which calls the Window class and creates the main application window

- `benchmark.algorithm`
Responsible for the algorithm classes

- `benchmark.core`
This package is crucial to the application, containing the essential classes required for its basic functionality, even without a user-friendly visual interface

- `benchmark.sysinterface.actions`
- `benchmark.sysinterface.visual`
