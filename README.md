## algorithm-benchmark

This software was developed as a project for my Computer Science degree, 3rd semester, under the title “MAKE A SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FOR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF DATA SORTING ALGORITHMS.”

The user just needs to choose the type of data to be sorted, the path, and the number of tests

It includes several packages and classes, which are explained below:

- `benchmark`
This package contains only the Main.java class, which calls the Window class and creates the main application window

- `benchmark.algorithm`
Responsible for the algorithm classes

- `benchmark.core`
This package is crucial to the application, containing the essential classes required for its basic functionality, even without a user-friendly visual interface

- `benchmark.sysinterface.actions`
- `benchmark.sysinterface.visual`
