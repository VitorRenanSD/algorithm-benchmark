_The user just needs to choose the type of data to be sorted, path, and quantity of tests to run_

## Project paths
This project includes several packages and classes, which are explained below:

- `benchmark`
This package contains only the Main.java class, which calls the Window class and creates the main application window

- `benchmark.algorithm`
Responsible for the algorithm classes (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort)

- `benchmark.core`
This package is the core of the application, containing the essential classes required for its basic functionality, can run without a user-friendly visual interface

- `benchmark.sysinterface`
